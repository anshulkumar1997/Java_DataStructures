Reversing a List

Jane is a programmer and she used to participate in various coding contests.  Since she is very much interested in data structure, she planned to participate in a contest for data structures conducted by 'Secrets of Champions'.  In that contest, she is asked to write a program in Java to perform following operations: 

Define a Class with following format:

class Node

{

int data;

Node  next;

}

Include functions

append --- to add data at the end of the linked list.

Reverse --- to reverse the linked list.

display --- to display all the data in the linked list.

How can you help her to write this code?

Note: Implement the main() inside the class 'List'



Input and Output Format:

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.



Sample Input and Output:

Enter the value:

9

Do you want to add another node? Type Yes/No

yes

Enter the value:

10

Do you want to add another node? Type Yes/No

Yes

Enter the value:

26

Do you want to add another node? Type Yes/No

Yes

Enter the value:

8

Do you want to add another node? Type Yes/No

no

The elements in the linked list are: 9 10 26 8

The elements in the reversed linked list are : 8 26 10 9
